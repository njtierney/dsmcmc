tidy.mcmc.list(mcmc_object, conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{

\item{conf.level}{level of the credible interval to be calculuated}
}
\value{
a data.table containing parameter summaries
}
\description{
A function that behaves like those from "broom", tidy.mcmc.list will take an mcmc.list object from coda.samples and return a data frame that summarises each parameters with its mean and quantiles and returns the output as a data.table object. This can be called as `tidy`. Currently summarises over all chains.
}
